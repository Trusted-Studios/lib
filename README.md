# Trusted-Studios Lib

The Trusted-Studios FiveM Lib provides many functions used in our scripts. Those where crafted over many years and exists to increase productivity. Even tho we work with our own lib, we recomend using [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) as it is much more complete and provides a wide range of tools unavailable in ours.
